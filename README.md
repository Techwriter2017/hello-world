# hello-world
This is the first assignment to create a repository.

My name is Cathie Ryan and I am a student at Middlesex Community College.  I am enrolled in a class where I will learn many tools and technologies for writing technical documents.  When I complete this class, I hope to start my career as a technical writer.
